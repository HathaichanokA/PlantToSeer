# PlantToSeer
a plant ontological-liked knowledge acquisition and plant learning system <br><br>
This senior project proposes a plant ontological-liked knowledge acquisition 
system that can manipulate and search for plant information. The proposed system aims 
to collect and store plant knowledge in repositories, placing emphasis on native Thai 
plants, which will include vegetables, fruits, and herbs. Details about the plants that are 
useful for health, or can be used as medicine to remedy symptoms, diseases, or provide
nourishment will be highlighted. <br><br>
The system was adapted from the technology called Ontology, which provides 
the core architecture of the proposed system. Users can manipulate and easily 
understand the plant details, and their relationships with related plants, and their 
characteristics.
